  <p>Those who say they can and those who say they can't are both usually right. Beating the odds and remaining humble allows one to perfect their craft. Before being a web developer I was just like your average 19 year old dreaming more than I was exceling. In and out of school working long shifts as a dishwasher in the midtown of NYC. Eventually before I got comfortable and settled I've decided to take the initiative and make a quick career change in a field I've never imagined doing. Hey I'm on my phone everyday so I might as well create applications that'll allow other individuals to visit my finished work and hopefully one day that'll inspire them just like how major names in tech like <em>Mark Zuckerberg</em> and twin brothers <em>Donte Morris</em> and <em>Dominic Morris</em> inspired me. Both brothers <em>Donte</em> & <em>Dominic</em> created the app HoopMaps starred on hit show Sharktank, <em>Zuckerberg</em> on the otherhand obviously creating the worlds most used application Facebook & his networth is allegedly $77.8b. I'm currently taking studies at NYCDA a tech school in lower Manhattan and so far i'm so in love with it i'm taking my steps slow but i'm getting more excited everyday as I continue to learn more and more each day. Years from now the sky is the limit only the man upstairs knows what will continue but what I know is at the end of pain is success if you want to be the best you have to work the hardest regardless.</p>
